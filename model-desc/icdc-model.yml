Nodes:
  program:
    Desc: Within the Integrated Canine Data Commons, studies are grouped into discrete programs, based upon the origins and/or scientific nature of each study/trial. These programs may or may not directly relate to any official, e.g. NCI, funding program. The Program node contains the properties required to appropriately characterize any given ICDC program.

  study_arm:
    Desc: The Study Arm node contains properties required to describe the arms into which any given study/trial was divided. Division of a study/trial into multiple arms is optional and is at the discretion of the data owners, based upon the way in which the study/trial in question was structured, and how best that structure can be represented within the ICDC. Where applicable, the appropriate study arms are defined during the study on-boarding process and then created via a specific data loading file.

  # agent:
  #   Desc: The Agent node documents the name of each therapeutic agent being administered during a clinical trial. In this way, in clinical trials which assess the efficacy of combination therapies, adverse events observed during the trial can be attributed specifically to one or more of the medications being used.

Where applicable, the appropriate cohorts are defined during the study on-boarding process and then created via a specific data loading file.

  case:
    Desc: The Case node contains properties required to unambiguously identify each patient/subject/donor, either based upon the data submitter's original ID, or upon a study-specific Case ID derived from it during data transformation, which prefixes each original ID with a short, study-specific code.

  registration:
    Desc: The Registration node functions to capture multiple IDs that may be associated with any single patient/subject/donor. Specifically, it captures multiple IDs in the form of Key:Value pairs, which represent each alternate ID and the specific source from which that alternate ID originates. These registrations can then be used to identify multi-study participants, i.e. canine individuals enrolled in two or more ICDC studies as study-specific cases, but which nonetheless represent the same underlying patient/subject/donor.

  canine_individual:
    Desc: The Canine Individual node contains only a single property, i.e. canine_individual_id, a loader-generated ID which identifies each underlying canine subject represented by two or more study-specific ICDC cases. This ID functions to map data sets ultimately derived from the same underlying patient/subject/donor, but generated from discrete cases in separate studies, to the underlying canine individual, such that all data sets derived from any given canine individual can be identified within the application’s user interface and combined.

  cycle:
    Desc: In clinical trials where therapeutic agents are administered in multiple discrete treatment cycles, the properties within the Cycle node serve to capture the dates upon which each cycle started and ended, providing a detailed timeframe for the therapeutic intervention(s) in question. Adverse events can then be associated with the correct cycle based upon when they were observed.

  visit:
    Desc: Clinical trials typically require the patient to make multiple visits to the study site for clinical evaluation and/or the administration of additional medication(s). Properties within the Visit node serve to capture the date upon which each visit occurs. Adverse events and various clinical assessments can then be associated with the correct visit based upon date.

  # proposing deprecation or removal of the off_treatment node as it contains no data across ingested studies as of 7/16/24.
  # off_treatment:
  #   Desc: Properties within the Off Treatment node detail when a clinical trial patient's treatment was curtailed relative to other key dates. Properties also detail the best response to treatment observed to that point, and the reason(s) for treatment being curtailed.
