registering_institution	TBD
registration_id	Any ID used by a data submitter to identify a patient/subject/donor, either locally or globally
registration_origin	The entity with which each registration ID is directly associated, for example, an ICDC study, as denoted by the appropriate study code, or the biobank or tissue repository from which samples for a study/trial participant were acquired, as denoted by the appropriate acronym
repository_name	The name of the image repository within which the image collection can be found, stated in the form of the appropriate acronym
sample_chronology	An indication as to when a sample was acquired relative to any therapeutic intervention and/or key disease outcome observations
sample_id	The globally unique ID by which any given sample can be unambiguously identified and displayed across studies/trials; specifically the preferred value of the sample identifier used by the data submitter, prefixed with the appropriate ICDC study code during data transformation
sample_preservation	The method by which a sample was preserved
sample_site	The specific anatomical location from which any given sample was acquired
sex	The biological sex of the patient/subject/donor
site_short_name	The widely-accepted acronym for the institution at which the patient/subject/donor was enrolled into the study/trial, and then treated under the appropriate veterinary medicine program
specific_sample_pathology	Indication as to specific histology and/or pathology associated with a sample
stage_of_disease	The formal assessment of the extent to which the primary cancer with which the patient/subject/donor has been diagnosed has progressed, according to the TNM staging or cancer stage grouping criteria
study_disposition	An arbitrarily-assigned value used to dictate how the study/trial is displayed via the ICDC Production environment, based upon the degree to which the data has been on-boarded and/or whether the data is subject to any temporary embargo which prevents its public rlease
summarized_sample_type	A summarized representation of a sample's physical nature, normality, and derivation from a primary versus a metastatic tumor, based upon the combination of values in the three independent properties of physical_sample_type, general_sample_pathology and tumor_sample_origin
surgical_finding	Findings_FUL on form
treatment_data	An indication as to the existence of any treatment data for the patient/subject/donor, typically in the form of a study-level supplemental data file
treatment_since_last_contact	y/n
tumor_grade	The grade of the tumor from which the sample was acquired, i.e. the dgree of cellular differentiation within the tumor in question, as determined by a pathologist's evaluation
tumor_sample_origin	An indication as to whether a tumor sample was derived from a primary versus a metastatic tumor
unexpected_adverse_event	bool
uuid	The universally unique alpha-numeric identifier assigned to each file
veterinary_medical_center	The full name of the insitution at which the patient/subject/donor was enrolled into the study/trial, and then treated under the appropriate veterinary medicine program, together with the site's city and state
volume_of_tumor	The volume of the tumor from which a tumor sample was derived, as measured in cm3
weight	The weight of the patient/subject/donor at the time of study/trial enrollment and/or biospecimens being acquired, at least in the case of studies that are not longitudinal in nature
width_of_tumor	The width of the tumor from which a tumor sample was derived, as measured in mm
year_of_publication	The year in which the cited work was published
